# MES_Solver

The purpose of this program is to solve the electric potential equation through the finite element method. 
The integration of functions is performed using the scipy library, while the matrix is solved using numpy. 
Finally, the plot is generated using matplotlib.

Project is a part of Differential Equations course at AGH UST
